Having witnessed the fourth industrial revolutionwhere Artificial Intelligence and other technologies are dominating the market. I am sure that you must come across reccomendation system in your everyday life . I am also sure that by this time curiosity must be getting the best of you.\n\n### The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users and also to understand how exactly it works\n"
